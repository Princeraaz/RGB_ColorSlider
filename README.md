#Requirements

You are required to design and create a Java Swing based application that implements Swing JSlider and a JTextArea.
Your application should consist of a Graphical User Interface, which draws a circle with a default diameter. To one side of the screen you should have four JSlider objects. Beneath all of this you should have a JTextArea. Use appropriate panels and layout managers to organise the GUI.

#Specifics

1. JSlider 1 will be used to control the diameter of the circle ­ sliding will increase or decrease the circle size.
2. The read­only JTextArea will be used to display details about the diameter, areas and circumference of the circle.
3. Other JSlider objects will be used to control the RGB color ratio used to fill the circle:
4. JSlider 2 controls the amount of Red
5. JSlider 3 controls the amount of Green
6. JSlider 4 controls the amount of Blue
7. The user will use a mouse to move slider positions with an immediate screen response
